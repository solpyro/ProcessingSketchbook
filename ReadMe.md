# Processing Sketchbook

This is my personal sketchbook of programs written in Processing. Some programs are entirely my on inventions while others are riffs on other peoples creations.
I also have a gallery over on [openprocessing.org](https://openprocessing.org/user/40162?o=7&view=sketches).

While I try to keep things tidy, this is an active folder (when I get chance to play in Processing) on at least two machines, so there will most likely be some mess and repetition.
